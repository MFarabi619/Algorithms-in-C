# Algorithms-in-C
A collection of algorithm solutions written in C. :) 

## Learning Goals
- To strengthen my C syntax.
- Improve on my problem-solving skills.
- Prepare for technical interviews.

## Learning log
- Running functions from separate files and folders in C.
- C ternary operator syntax.
- Using the isdigit() function to filter user input.
- When working with multiple C files, they need to be compiled together in the terminal first, and re-compiled every single time files are changed. This can become a tedious process. A tool that solves this problem and automates the process is called Makefile.
- Using the isspace() function to check if a character is whitespace.
- Getting length of string with strlen() function.
- Filtering input strictly for valid integers
- Whenever a string is declared in C, the compiler automatically appends a null terminator to the end of the string, denoted by '\0'.

## Future improvements
- Use regex for input filtering.
